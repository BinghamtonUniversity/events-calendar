                  <h1>Graduate Study in Department Name Here</h1>
                  
                  <p>Binghamton University is one of the four university centers in the State University
                     of New York, one of the largest systems of public higher education in the United States.
                     The university has a strong commitment to academic and research excellence, and the
                     department has an excellent national reputation — its smaller size allows individual
                     attention to students, yet it is consistently ranked among the top 75 departments
                     in the country. This makes Binghamton an outstanding choice for graduate study.
                  </p>
                  
                  <h2>Integrative Program of Study</h2>
                  
                  <p>An integrated departmental approach to graduate instruction results in exposure of
                     all graduate students to faculty from each specialization, thereby offering students
                     the opportunity to gain theoretical and practical expertise from a number of different
                     perspectives. The three graduate programs train students to carry out basic and applied
                     research and to communicate concepts effectively. This preparation enables our graduates
                     to compete successfully for academic appointments, positions at research or clinical
                     institutions, and placements in human services and industry. All graduate students
                     in good standing receive tuition waivers and are supported by stipends which go a
                     long way especially given the low cost of living in the Binghamton area.
                  </p>
